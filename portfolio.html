            <h2>Technical Portfolio</h2>
            Through my classwork, work experience, and personal projects, I've been able to work on a wide array of projects
            that I believe has allowed me to exercise both my technical and problem solving skills. <br>
            <br>
            In regards to personal projects, although I do not have any complete right now, I have recently started a project with one of 
            my colleagues. This project involves converting an RC (remote-controlled) car, into a turret vehicle that can shoot Nerf bullets
            and aim using a <a href="https://ouster.com/products/scanning-lidar/os1-sensor/" class="underline-text">Lidar</a> sensor. My personal participation on this project thus far has been hardware based, as we are in the early
            stages of working with the RC car. However, as we progress with the project, I am going to use <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html" class="underline-text">OpenCV</a>
            as a base for image tracking software, and fine tune it so it will target specific objects using the Lidar sensor. <br>
            <br>
            I have been exposed to most of my projects through college coursework. For example, Spring 2022 I took CSCE 312 (Computer Organization), where
            we designed a virtual CPU from the ground up using just basic logic gates. Additionally, another course I took was CSCE 221 (Data Structures & Algorithms).
            This course contained many programming assignments. A particular project was to code upwards of 5 searching/sorting algorithms as a basic introduction
            to the concept. This was coded in C++ and worked by the user selecting which sorting/searching algorithm they would like to run on a set of data. This 
            course also provided me with knowledge of C++ class templating so multiple data types could be taken as arguments. <br> <br>
