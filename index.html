            <h2>About Me</h2>
            Hi! My name is Emily Wax and I'm a Senior Computer Science Major at <a href = "https://www.tamu.edu/" class="underline-text">Texas A&M</a>. I am from Frisco, TX 
           and have been involved in STEM ever since high school where I cofounded the Girls in STEM club and got involved in 
           FRC robotics my senior year at <a href="https://schools.friscoisd.org/campus/high-school/reedy/home" class="underline-text">Reedy High School</a>. <br>
            <br>
            I've continued to foster my love of engineering in college through hackathons, my classes, mentoring robotics, and becoming a counselor
            for FREE (Freshmen Reaching Excellence in Engineering). In my free time I enjoy playing instruments such as 
            electric bass, keyboard, and guitar. I also have a passion for the outdoors. I work at <a href = "https://recsports.tamu.edu/outdoor-adventures/" class="underline-text">Texas A&M Outdoor Adventures</a>, am a member of
            <a href = "https://aggieoutdoors.wixsite.com/ao-1" class="underline-text">Aggie Outdoors</a>, and really enjoy climbing, slacklining, hiking, and travelling as well. <br>
            <br>

            Whether I'm working on a programming project or climbing a route, I love problem-solving in any way, shape, or form, and enjoy the challenge
            of solving these mental and physical problems. As a computer scienctist, I'm looking a passionate, creativity-driven environment where
            I can grow along with a company. To learn more about me, be sure to connect with me and click the links to access the other sections of my website.
