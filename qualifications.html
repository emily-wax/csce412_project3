            <h2>Qualifications & Technical Experience</h2>
            Through my coursework and work experience I've been fortunate to gain a wide variety of skills that I believe would make me a 
            valuable asset to any company. The first of many prevalent ways I've been able to gain experience is through employment. <br> <br> Summer of
            2022 I worked at <a href="https://www.raytheonintelligenceandspace.com/" class="underline-text">Raytheon Intelligence & Space</a> as a software engineering 
            intern. I worked with one other intern and a team of <a href="https://www.raytheonintelligenceandspace.com/what-we-do/department-22" class="underline-text">Department 22</a> software engineers on an Internal Research & Development Project 
            (IRAD) that focused on adapting an AI platform that could denoise images in specific ways based on consumer input. Although I 
            did not work directly on the denoising algorithm, I got exposure to that process and learned a lot of other valuable industry skills.
            I made many tangible contributions to the project, the first of which being an embedded hashtable that used metadata and UUIDs to connect
            denoised images with their original versions. I also wrote a Dockerfile that created an environment with Pytorch, Python, and other 
            dependencies. One of the biggest contributions, however, was a scriipt that used Python-C API to wrap a denoising script. Although the 
            actual algorithm was run using Python, the framework of the system was written in C++. By the end of the summer, I had written a script that
            allowed the whole denoising process to run using Python and a data mount between containers. Other skills picked up during this internship
            were DevOps tools, Gitlab, and CI/CD pipelines.<br>
            <br>

            The other part of my techincal experience I would like to highlight is one that is no longer displayed on my resume. That is working as a 
            summer camp counselor at <a href="https://campchampions.com/" class="underline-text">Camp Champions</a> during Summer of 2020 & 2021. Although from a 
            programming perspective this may not immediately seem beneficial, I would say that I gained many many invaluable skills during my time working.
            One of the biggest takeaways from working as a camp counselor was the ability to work in a team and solve conflict. During the day,
            I would work with my colleagues at either the ropes course or climbing wall to supervise 30+ kids at a time and ensure their safety. When
            activities finished, I would working with my co-counselor to plan activities for the kids, whether it be after dinner events or a 
            nightly bonding activity. My conflict resolution activities were put to the test every day. At times, kids can act a little rebellious towards
            you or even their fellow cabinmates. As a counselor, I felt I could excel in my position by resolving conflict in a calming, understanding 
            manner, turning them into opportunites for growth instead of punishment.
