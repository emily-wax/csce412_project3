            <h2>Service</h2>
            Service has been a big part of my life ever since high school. As a junior & senior I participated in National Honors Society. I also
            graduated with 100+ service hours, earning me a chord at graduation. Many of these hours came from the <a href="https://campchampions.com/prospective-families/high-school-leadership-program" class="underline-text">Senior Camper Program</a>
            at Camp Champions. This was a 3 year service program that gave me the opportunity to give back to a camp that I had
            been going to since I was 8. This program included service in many different ways such as, manual labor jobs around camp,
            leading a cabin of younger kids throughout the day, cleaning camp dishes, and going out into the Boys & Girls Club of Marble Falls
            to give back to the community. <br> <br>

            I still try to find ways to give back to my community in college. The first way I've been able to do so is by mentoring my old FRC robotics
            team (EGM Robotics). Throughout their build season I aided their software and mechanical team in troubleshooting and helped with last minute
            fixes during competitions. Additionally, I was on staff for a Freshman Leadership Org (FLO) as a sophomore at Texas A&M. This allowed me 
            to mentor freshmen coming into college and help them get the most of their A&M experience.
