        <p>Hi! My name is Emily Wax and I'm a Junior Computer Science Major at <a href = "https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M</a>. I am from Frisco, TX <br>
            and have been involved in STEM ever since high school. I cofounded the Girls in STEM at my high schoole (Reedy High), and got involved in <br>
            FRC robotics my senior year of high school as a way to foster my passion for engineering. In my free time I enjoy playing instruments such as <br>
            electric bass, keyboard, and guitar. I have a passion for the outdoors, more specifically climbing, slacklining, and hiking, and am a member of <br>
            <a href = "https://aggieoutdoors.wixsite.com/ao-1">Aggie Outdoors</a>, which provides me with a community that continuously helps me grow in these specific hobbies. No matter what I'm doing, I make <br>

            drives me to succeed! As a computer science student, I am looking for an innovative environment that encourages creative thinking and problem <br>
